# MantisBT Note Reply - a plugin that adds reply buttons to issues

A "reply" button is added next to the buttons of an issue, and clicking on it will quote the issue description in the "add note" area. Additionally, if any part of the description text is selected, only that part will be quoted.

The same button will be added to every note in the issue, making it easier to also quote note comments.

Works for Mantis version 2.1.0 and above.
